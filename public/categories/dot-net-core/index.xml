 Part 2: Using Visual Studio 2017 with better tooling and bugfixes. How to publish dotnet core apps to ubuntu without installing dotnet runtime: self contained apps development
As a continuation of the previous post I tried to do the same with VS 2017 which supposedly has better tooling for Dot Net Core. I did also see the cspoj and xml structures were altered ( maybe for good - I am too noob to comment); but long story short, I had to dig around to get it working and compile the correct platform specific runtimes binaries.</description>

 Part 1: Using Visual Studio 2015 which has a different tooling than 2017 How to publish dotnet core apps to ubuntu without installing dotnet runtime: self contained apps development? I started exploring this option driven by a specific need. I have a bunch of applications and classes already available on different C# .NET projects scattered all over the place. Many of these libraries include complex neumerical functions, database transactions classes and image processing codes all written in C#.</description>

 Ubuntu 16.04 While most of the install instructions for .NET core works from the microsoft website it is vastly generic for all versions of Linux distros available. Here I tried to install on a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and faced some issues. Of course .NET Core itself is pretty new and expecting standard versioning and dependency management across distros might be challenging even for Microsoft.</description>
